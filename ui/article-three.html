                    Procrastination means to postpone doing something, especially as a regular practice. It is also to delay something that one should do and it is not done because one does not want to do it.
                    There are habits that do not do any good to people but harm, procrastination is one among them.

                    As it's said commonly that things have their own merits and demerits or pros and cons, but in case of procrastination, there can be no advantages except disadvantages because the implied meaning of procrastination is delaying doing something that should be done on time.
                    What advantage can one gain if he postpones doing necessary things? Conversely, the things that are supposed to be done must be done on time, so that the desired results may be attained accordingly.
